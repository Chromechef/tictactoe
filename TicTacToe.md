# Tic Tac Toe

Welcome to the first study group. Our target is one hour.

This will help us build practice by using GitHub with pull request and merging in a group environment.  


Here we are going to go over some fundamentals  of web development by creating a simple app of TicTacToe.


The goal is to make this as responsive as possible within the time. 


This project will be broken down by 4 files.
- HTML
- CSS
- JS containing 2 files
  - main.js
  - data.js
 
 ## The Game
 The App will render two random animal images on the top for player 1 and player 2.
 
1. Player one goes first and clicks in the grid the player one image will be placed
2. Player two selects a grid and the player 2 image will be placed

### Stretch Goals

1. Player one gets to choose their animal by clicking
2. From this point it will bounce between player 2 and 1
3. When three images are in a row it will declare that player the winner
4. If a tie game it will render a Tie game.
